If in Windows world use WSL2 as much as possible. I sat up Ubuntu as my default Windows terminal in Win11

Get used to using short names for kubernetes resources. Easier and faster to type.

Consider making your own flashcards to memorize various things (I used cram.com - free)

Research when you bump into behavior that surprices you. For instance I couldn't understand why 'kg secret -oyaml' gave a different result than 'kd secret'. I asked ChatGPT about the differences and got a great explanation I could verify subsequently. Turns out, 'k describe secret' implicitly base64 decodes, which 'k get secret' does not. Good to know!
